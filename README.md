# Virtual Prototyping of Industrial Robot Based on Unity3D
## *Description*
1. Aimed to build 3D model of the industrial robot based on the Unity 3D, and use the six-axis motion data of the industrial robot to drive the 3d model, so as to realize real-time synchronous motion between virtual model and real object.
2. Completed the CAD modeling and motion analysis of the mechanical arm. Wrote the related program of virtual prototype of mechanical arm and built the display interface.
3. Used Socket to connect the industrial robot with the upper computer. Wrote the network service program between the upper computer and the lower computer, etc..

## *Instruction*
Folder 'Virtual Factory' is already a Unity3D project. Recommend to use a version of Unity3D above **2018.2** to open this project.
